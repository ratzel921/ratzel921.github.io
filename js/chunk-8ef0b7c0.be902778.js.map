This Data Protection Declaration explains which data we collect\n            as\n            well as the purposes we use this data for.

In the case of\n            explicit\n            consent to the transfer of personal data to third countries, the data processing is also based on Art. 49\n            (1)(a)\n            GDPR. If you have consented to the storage of cookies or to the access to information in your end device\n            (e.g.,\n            via device fingerprinting), the data processing is additionally based on &sect; 25 (1) TTDSG. The consent\n            can be\n            revoked at any time. If your data is required for the fulfillment of a contract or for the implementation of\n            pre-contractual measures, we process your data on the basis of Art. 6(1)(b) GDPR. Furthermore, if your data\n            is\n            required for the fulfillment of a legal obligation, we process it on the basis of Art. 6(1)(c) GDPR.\n            Furthermore,\n            the data processing may be carried out on the basis of our legitimate interest according to Art. 6(1)(f)\n            GDPR.\n            Information on the relevant legal basis in each individual case is provided in the following paragraphs of\n            this\n            privacy policy.</p>\n          <h3>Information on data transfer to the USA and other non-EU countries</h3>\n          <p>Among other things, we use tools of companies domiciled in the United States or other from a data\n            protection\n            perspective non-secure non-EU countries.

We must point out that in these countries,\n            a\n            data protection level that is comparable to that in the EU cannot be guaranteed. For instance, U.S.\n            enterprises\n            are under a mandate to release personal data to the security agencies and you as the data subject do not\n            have any\n            litigation options to defend yourself in court. Hence, it cannot be ruled out that U.S. agencies (e.g., the\n            Secret\n            Service) may process, analyze, and permanently archive your personal data for surveillance purposes.
