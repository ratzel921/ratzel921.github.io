          <h2>3. General information and mandatory information</h2>
          <h3>Data protection</h3>
          <p>The operators of this website and its pages take the protection of your personal data very seriously.
            Hence, we
            handle your personal data as confidential information and in compliance with the statutory data protection
            regulations and this Data Protection Declaration.</p>
          <p>Whenever you use this website, a variety of personal information will be collected. Personal data comprises
            data
            that can be used to personally identify you. This Data Protection Declaration explains which data we collect
            as
            well as the purposes we use this data for. It also explains how, and for which purpose the information is
            collected.</p>
          <p>We herewith advise you that the transmission of data via the Internet (i.e., through e-mail communications)
            may
            be prone to security gaps. It is not possible to completely protect data against third-party access.</p>
          <h3>Information about the responsible party (referred to as the &ldquo;controller&rdquo; in the GDPR)</h3>
          <p>The data processing controller on this website is:</p>
          <p>DR Solutions UG (haftungsbeschränkt)<br/>
            Birkenweg 11<br/>
            71159 Mötzingen</p>

          <p>E-Mail: dominikratzel16@gmail.com</p>
          <p>The controller is the natural person or legal entity that single-handedly or jointly with others makes
            decisions
            as to the purposes of and resources for the processing of personal data (e.g., names, e-mail addresses,
            etc.).</p>

          <h3>Storage duration</h3>
          <p>Unless a more specific storage period has been specified in this privacy policy, your personal data will
            remain
            with us until the purpose for which it was collected no longer applies. If you assert a justified request
            for
            deletion or revoke your consent to data processing, your data will be deleted, unless we have other legally
            permissible reasons for storing your personal data (e.g., tax or commercial law retention periods); in the
            latter
            case, the deletion will take place after these reasons cease to apply.</p>
          <h3>General information on the legal basis for the data processing on this website</h3>
          <p>If you have consented to data processing, we process your personal data on the basis of Art. 6(1)(a) GDPR
            or Art.
            9 (2)(a) GDPR, if special categories of data are processed according to Art. 9 (1) DSGVO. In the case of
            explicit
            consent to the transfer of personal data to third countries, the data processing is also based on Art. 49
            (1)(a)
            GDPR. If you have consented to the storage of cookies or to the access to information in your end device
            (e.g.,
            via device fingerprinting), the data processing is additionally based on &sect; 25 (1) TTDSG. The consent
            can be
            revoked at any time. If your data is required for the fulfillment of a contract or for the implementation of
            pre-contractual measures, we process your data on the basis of Art. 6(1)(b) GDPR. Furthermore, if your data
            is
            required for the fulfillment of a legal obligation, we process it on the basis of Art. 6(1)(c) GDPR.
            Furthermore,
            the data processing may be carried out on the basis of our legitimate interest according to Art. 6(1)(f)
            GDPR.
            Information on the relevant legal basis in each individual case is provided in the following paragraphs of
            this
            privacy policy.</p>
          <h3>Information on data transfer to the USA and other non-EU countries</h3>
          <p>Among other things, we use tools of companies domiciled in the United States or other from a data
            protection
            perspective non-secure non-EU countries. If these tools are active, your personal data may potentially be
            transferred to these non-EU countries and may be processed there. We must point out that in these countries,
            a
            data protection level that is comparable to that in the EU cannot be guaranteed. For instance, U.S.
            enterprises
            are under a mandate to release personal data to the security agencies and you as the data subject do not
            have any
            litigation options to defend yourself in court. Hence, it cannot be ruled out that U.S. agencies (e.g., the
            Secret
            Service) may process, analyze, and permanently archive your personal data for surveillance purposes. We have
            no
            control over these processing activities.</p>
          <h3>Revocation of your consent to the processing of data</h3>
          <p>A wide range of data processing transactions are possible only subject to your express consent. You can
            also
            revoke at any time any consent you have already given us. This shall be without prejudice to the lawfulness
            of any
            data collection that occurred prior to your revocation.</p>
          <h3>Right to object to the collection of data in special cases; right to object to direct advertising (Art. 21
            GDPR)</h3>
          <p>IN THE EVENT THAT DATA ARE PROCESSED ON THE BASIS OF ART. 6(1)(E) OR (F) GDPR, YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO AT ANY
            TIME
            OBJECT TO THE PROCESSING OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA BASED ON GROUNDS ARISING FROM YOUR UNIQUE SITUATION. THIS
            ALSO
            APPLIES TO ANY PROFILING BASED ON THESE PROVISIONS. TO DETERMINE THE LEGAL BASIS, ON WHICH ANY PROCESSING OF
            DATA
            IS BASED, PLEASE CONSULT THIS DATA PROTECTION DECLARATION. IF YOU LOG AN OBJECTION, WE WILL NO LONGER
            PROCESS YOUR
            AFFECTED PERSONAL DATA, UNLESS WE ARE IN A POSITION TO PRESENT COMPELLING PROTECTION WORTHY GROUNDS FOR THE
            PROCESSING OF YOUR DATA, THAT OUTWEIGH YOUR INTERESTS, RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS OR IF THE PURPOSE OF THE
            PROCESSING IS
            THE CLAIMING, EXERCISING OR DEFENCE OF LEGAL ENTITLEMENTS (OBJECTION PURSUANT TO ART. 21(1) GDPR).</p>
          <p>IF YOUR PERSONAL DATA IS BEING PROCESSED IN ORDER TO ENGAGE IN DIRECT ADVERTISING, YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO
            OBJECT
            TO THE PROCESSING OF YOUR AFFECTED PERSONAL DATA FOR THE PURPOSES OF SUCH ADVERTISING AT ANY TIME. THIS ALSO
            APPLIES TO PROFILING TO THE EXTENT THAT IT IS AFFILIATED WITH SUCH DIRECT ADVERTISING. IF YOU OBJECT, YOUR
            PERSONAL DATA WILL SUBSEQUENTLY NO LONGER BE USED FOR DIRECT ADVERTISING PURPOSES (OBJECTION PURSUANT TO
            ART.
            21(2) GDPR).</p>
          <h3>Right to log a complaint with the competent supervisory agency</h3>
          <p>In the event of violations of the GDPR, data subjects are entitled to log a complaint with a supervisory
            agency,
            in particular in the member state where they usually maintain their domicile, place of work or at the place
            where
            the alleged violation occurred. The right to log a complaint is in effect regardless of any other
            administrative
            or court proceedings available as legal recourses.</p>
          <h3>Right to data portability</h3>
          <p>You have the right to have data that we process automatically on the basis of your consent or in
            fulfillment of a
            contract handed over to you or to a third party in a common, machine-readable format. If you should demand
            the
            direct transfer of the data to another controller, this will be done only if it is technically feasible.</p>
          <h3>Information about, rectification and eradication of data</h3>
          <p>Within the scope of the applicable statutory provisions, you have the right to demand information about
            your
            archived personal data, their source and recipients as well as the purpose of the processing of your data at
            any
            time. You may also have a right to have your data rectified or eradicated. If you have questions about this
            subject matter or any other questions about personal data, please do not hesitate to contact us at any
            time.</p>
          <h3>Right to demand processing restrictions</h3>
          <p>You have the right to demand the imposition of restrictions as far as the processing of your personal data
            is
            concerned. To do so, you may contact us at any time. The right to demand restriction of processing applies
            in the
            following cases:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>In the event that you should dispute the correctness of your data archived by us, we will usually need
              some
              time to verify this claim. During the time that this investigation is ongoing, you have the right to
              demand that
              we restrict the processing of your personal data.
            </li>
            <li>If the processing of your personal data was/is conducted in an unlawful manner, you have the option to
              demand
              the restriction of the processing of your data instead of demanding the eradication of this data.
            </li>
            <li>If we do not need your personal data any longer and you need it to exercise, defend or claim legal
              entitlements, you have the right to demand the restriction of the processing of your personal data instead
              of
              its eradication.
            </li>
            <li>If you have raised an objection pursuant to Art. 21(1) GDPR, your rights and our rights will have to be
              weighed against each other. As long as it has not been determined whose interests prevail, you have the
              right to
              demand a restriction of the processing of your personal data.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>If you have restricted the processing of your personal data, these data &ndash; with the exception of their
            archiving &ndash; may be processed only subject to your consent or to claim, exercise or defend legal
            entitlements
            or to protect the rights of other natural persons or legal entities or for important public interest reasons
            cited
            by the European Union or a member state of the EU.</p>
          <h3>SSL and/or TLS encryption</h3>
          <p>For security reasons and to protect the transmission of confidential content, such as purchase orders or
            inquiries you submit to us as the website operator, this website uses either an SSL or a TLS encryption
            program.
            You can recognize an encrypted connection by checking whether the address line of the browser switches from
            &ldquo;http://&rdquo; to &ldquo;https://&rdquo; and also by the appearance of the lock icon in the browser
            line.</p>
          <p>If the SSL or TLS encryption is activated, data you transmit to us cannot be read by third parties.</p>
          <h3>Encrypted payment transactions on this website</h3>
          <p>If you are under an obligation to share your payment information (e.g. account number if you give us the
            authority to debit your bank account) with us after you have entered into a fee-based contract with us, this
            information is required to process payments.</p>
          <p>Payment transactions using common modes of paying (Visa/MasterCard, debit to your bank account) are
            processed
            exclusively via encrypted SSL or TLS connections. You can recognize an encrypted connection by checking
            whether
            the address line of the browser switches from &ldquo;http://&rdquo; to &ldquo;https://&rdquo; and also by
            the
            appearance of the lock icon in the browser line.</p>
          <p>If the communication with us is encrypted, third parties will not be able to read the payment information
            you
            share with us.</p>
          <h2>4. Recording of data on this website</h2>
          <h3>Cookies</h3>
          <p>Our websites and pages use what the industry refers to as &ldquo;cookies.&rdquo; Cookies are small data
            packages
            that do not cause any damage to your device. They are either stored temporarily for the duration of a
            session
            (session cookies) or they are permanently archived on your device (permanent cookies). Session cookies are
            automatically deleted once you terminate your visit. Permanent cookies remain archived on your device until
            you
            actively delete them, or they are automatically eradicated by your web browser.</p>
          <p>Cookies can be issued by us (first-party cookies) or by third-party companies (so-called third-party
            cookies).
            Third-party cookies enable the integration of certain services of third-party companies into websites (e.g.,
            cookies for handling payment services).</p>
          <p>Cookies have a variety of functions. Many cookies are technically essential since certain website functions
            would
            not work in the absence of these cookies (e.g., the shopping cart function or the display of videos). Other
            cookies may be used to analyze user behavior or for promotional purposes.</p>
          <p>Cookies, which are required for the performance of electronic communication transactions, for the provision
            of
            certain functions you want to use (e.g., for the shopping cart function) or those that are necessary for the
            optimization (required cookies) of the website (e.g., cookies that provide measurable insights into the web
            audience), shall be stored on the basis of Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR, unless a different legal basis is cited. The
            operator of the website has a legitimate interest in the storage of required cookies to ensure the
            technically
            error-free and optimized provision of the operator&rsquo;s services. If your consent to the storage of the
            cookies
            and similar recognition technologies has been requested, the processing occurs exclusively on the basis of
            the
            consent obtained (Art. 6(1)(a) GDPR and &sect; 25 (1) TTDSG); this consent may be revoked at any time.</p>
          <p>You have the option to set up your browser in such a manner that you will be notified any time cookies are
            placed
            and to permit the acceptance of cookies only in specific cases. You may also exclude the acceptance of
            cookies in
            certain cases or in general or activate the delete-function for the automatic eradication of cookies when
            the

          <h3 id="contact">Contact form</h3>
          <p>If you submit inquiries to us via our contact form, the information provided in the contact form as well as
            any
            contact information provided therein will be stored by us in order to handle your inquiry and in the event
            that we
            have further questions. We will not share this information without your consent.</p>
          <p>The processing of these data is based on Art. 6(1)(b) GDPR, if your request is related to the execution of
            a
            contract or if it is necessary to carry out pre-contractual measures. In all other cases the processing is
            based
            on our legitimate interest in the effective processing of the requests addressed to us (Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR)
            or on
            your agreement (Art. 6(1)(a) GDPR) if this has been requested; the consent can be revoked at any time.</p>
          <p>The information you have entered into the contact form shall remain with us until you ask us to eradicate
            the
            data, revoke your consent to the archiving of data or if the purpose for which the information is being
            archived
            no longer exists (e.g., after we have concluded our response to your inquiry). This shall be without
            prejudice to
            any mandatory legal provisions, in particular retention periods.</p>
          <h3>Request by e-mail, telephone, or fax</h3>
          <p>If you contact us by e-mail, telephone or fax, your request, including all resulting personal data (name,
            request) will be stored and processed by us for the purpose of processing your request. We do not pass these
            data
            on without your consent.</p>
          <p>These data are processed on the basis of Art. 6(1)(b) GDPR if your inquiry is related to the fulfillment of
            a
            contract or is required for the performance of pre-contractual measures. In all other cases, the data are
            processed on the basis of our legitimate interest in the effective handling of inquiries submitted to us
            (Art.
            6(1)(f) GDPR) or on the basis of your consent (Art. 6(1)(a) GDPR) if it has been obtained; the consent can
            be
            revoked at any time.</p>
          <p>The data sent by you to us via contact requests remain with us until you request us to delete, revoke your
            consent to the storage or the purpose for the data storage lapses (e.g. after completion of your request).
            Mandatory statutory provisions - in particular statutory retention periods - remain unaffected.</p>
          <h3>Registration on this website</h3>

          <h4>Hosting</h4>

          <h2>6. Plug-ins and Tools</h2>
          <h3>YouTube with expanded data protection integration</h3>
          <p>Our website embeds videos of the website YouTube. The website operator is Google Ireland Limited (&ldquo;Google&rdquo;),
            Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Ireland.</p>
          <p>We use YouTube in the expanded data protection mode. According to YouTube, this mode ensures that YouTube
            does
            not store any information about visitors to this website before they watch the video. Nevertheless, this
            does not
            necessarily mean that the sharing of data with YouTube partners can be ruled out as a result of the expanded
            data
            protection mode. For instance, regardless of whether you are watching a video, YouTube will always establish
            a
            connection with the Google DoubleClick network.</p>
          <p>As soon as you start to play a YouTube video on this website, a connection to YouTube&rsquo;s servers will
            be
            established. As a result, the YouTube server will be notified, which of our pages you have visited. If you
            are
            logged into your YouTube account while you visit our site, you enable YouTube to directly allocate your
            browsing
            patterns to your personal profile. You have the option to prevent this by logging out of your YouTube
            account.</p>
          <p>Furthermore, after you have started to play a video, YouTube will be able to place various cookies on your
            device
            or comparable technologies for recognition (e.g. device fingerprinting). In this way YouTube will be able to
            obtain information about this website&rsquo;s visitors. Among other things, this information will be used to
            generate video statistics with the aim of improving the user friendliness of the site and to prevent
            attempts to
            commit fraud.</p>
          <p>Under certain circumstances, additional data processing transactions may be triggered after you have
            started to
            play a YouTube video, which are beyond our control.</p>
          <p>The use of YouTube is based on our interest in presenting our online content in an appealing manner.
            Pursuant to
            Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR, this is a legitimate interest. If appropriate consent has been obtained, the processing
            is
            carried out exclusively on the basis of Art. 6(1)(a) GDPR and &sect; 25 (1) TTDSG, insofar the consent
            includes
            the storage of cookies or the access to information in the user&rsquo;s end device (e.g., device
            fingerprinting)
            within the meaning of the TTDSG. This consent can be revoked at any time.</p>

          <h3>Processing of Customer and Contract Data</h3>
          <p>We collect, process, and use personal customer and contract data for the establishment, content arrangement
            and
            modification of our contractual relationships. Data with personal references to the use of this website
            (usage
            data) will be collected, processed, and used only if this is necessary to enable the user to use our
            services or
            required for billing purposes. The legal basis for these processes is Art. 6(1)(b) GDPR.</p>
          <p>The collected customer data shall be deleted upon completion of the order or termination of the business
            relationship and upon expiration of any existing statutory archiving periods. This shall be without
            prejudice to
            any statutory archiving periods.</p>
          <h3>Payment services</h3>
          <p>We integrate payment services of third-party companies on our website. When you make a purchase from us,
            your
            payment data (e.g. name, payment amount, bank account details, credit card number) are processed by the
            payment
            service provider for the purpose of payment processing. For these transactions, the respective contractual
            and
            data protection provisions of the respective providers apply. The use of the payment service providers is
            based on
            Art. 6(1)(b) GDPR (contract processing) and in the interest of a smooth, convenient, and secure payment
            transaction (Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR). Insofar as your consent is requested for certain actions, Art. 6(1)(a) GDPR
            is
            the legal basis for data processing; consent may be revoked at any time for the future.</p>
